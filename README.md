Hello, my name is Max and I am a front-end developer. 
This is my personal website where you can get to know me better and evaluate my skills.
I've been  coding in JavaScript and React for about a 2 year now. I have experience in creating responsive, cross-browser websites and web applications. I use html, css, sass, tailwind, JavaScript, React and Redux. 
I am currently learning Typescript and Bootstrap. I have an understanding of Git and Webpack. I am proficient in VS Code, Figma and Adobe Illustrator.
My main goal is to learn new cool skills, practice the ones I've already acquired, become part of a cool team and an incredibly interesting project, and realise my potential as a developer.
For now, thank you for considering me, have a good day.
